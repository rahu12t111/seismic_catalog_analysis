To create plots for catalog analysis RUN : "python3 Plots.py"

programme will ask for inputs :-

file_name = string for file name present in same directory.
# NOTE : Input file should be an CSV file with column names ["Date Time","latitude","longitude","magnitude","Depth"] and "|" as seperator. #

OUTPUT:-
1) for get a 2D histogram.
2) magnitude<=cutoff VS time for different magnitude range in same plots.
3) magnitude<= cutoff VS time in different graphs.
4) 1D Kernel density Plots.
5) 1D log(kernel) density Plot. 
6) mag vs log(cumulative_count)
7) mag vs log count
8) mag. <= 5 VS time
9) 2D distplot
10) 1D kernel density plot
11) basic catalog info
12) mag. VS time
13) depth VS time
14) mag. VS depth
15) mag. histogram
16) depth histogram
17) In depth catalog profile
18) HTML map of the catalog with event info
